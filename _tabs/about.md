Hi there! I'm dreaming of becoming a Data Scientist, **specializing in Recommender Systems**. I graduated from the Department of Economics and deeply researched Business Economics, including Consumer Theory, Game Theory, Information Economics, etc. While completing my major, I became interested in consumers' preferences and choices. So, I want to conduct research on curating items that match consumer preferences under information uncertainty about their tastes. Now, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at The Graduate School of Kookmin University, under the guidance of Prof. Je-Hyuk Lee.
