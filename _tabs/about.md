Hi there! I'm dreaming of becoming an **expert in recommender systems**. I graduated from the Department of Economics and deeply researched Business Economics, including Consumer Theory, Game Theory, Information Economics, etc. While completing my major, I became interested in consumers' preferences and choices. So, I want to conduct research on analyzing personal freedom of expression, defining personal preference, predicting personal choices, and recommending goods or services. Now, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at The Graduate School of Kookmin University, under the guidance of Prof. Je-hyuk Lee.
